Can you map a head onto a body live?

180
00:10:54.298 --> 00:10:55.538
Depends if your camera's moving.

181
00:10:55.539 --> 00:11:00.907
Rule sheet specifies a single hand-held
camera in a constant roving motion.

182
00:11:00.923 --> 00:11:02.251
Mm.

183
00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:05.360
Yeah, Gonzo style.
He knows his shit. That's tough.

184
00:11:06.727 --> 00:11:08.688
"Fruition to be transmitted
in full"?

185
00:11:09.454 --> 00:11:13.098
Focus on the visuals. Different face
mapped onto a live performer.

186
00:11:13.437 --> 00:11:14.999
According to those stipulations.

187
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.764
Fringes of possibility...

188
00:11:16.803 --> 00:11:19.874
Deadline's at four. We need to know
if it's workable by two.

190

191
00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:27.497
It has to.

192
00:11:27.498 --> 00:11:31.417
Our embeds have ruled out the major
players. It's not AQ, not IRA.

This is what's left...
radicals, hate groups.

People who've threatened yourself

195

They're being pulled in as we speak.

196
00:11:40.138 --> 00:11:41.710

197
00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:43.773

201
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.537
Nothing. Must be a hoax.

Brief mention of the ransom being
"a sex act". Nothing too gross.

Big grab of Susannah...

And we are.

00:17:31.938 --> 00:17:35.057
It wasn't a collective "you".
It was a singular "you", ie me.

320
00:17:35.058 --> 00:17:38.897
Sir, we may have something. Jamie's
been tracing the video's origin.

321

Technically, yes, so I thought,
"Work with what we do now"

That video, before Youtube
compression it was 57.3 meg.

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:54.659
Anyway, we also know
it was uploaded at 3:16 AM.

is a postcode.

329
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.777

Full squad. I'll man it.

00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:42.652
Yes!

341
00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:02.057
Right. Confident?

342
00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:05.217
It's a kick-bollock scramble,
but with finessing it should be OK.

343

That's what I'm wondering.

351
00:19:28.978 --> 00:19:30.268
There won't be any invoicing.

352
