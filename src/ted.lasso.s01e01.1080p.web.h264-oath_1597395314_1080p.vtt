00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:11.346
Come on! Come on! Let's do this!

2
00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.446
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

3
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:13.641
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.380
Rupert and I bought this
on our fifth anniversary.

5
00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:52.335
Well, you have exquisite taste.

6
00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:54.594
Do you want it?

7
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.136
But it's a Hockney.
It must be worth a million pounds.

8
00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.976
Good point. You should've said yes.

9
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.862
- Auction pile, please.
- Right away, ma'am.

10
00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.855
So, Mrs. Mannion...

11
00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:14.197
Excuse me. Ms. Welton.

12
00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:16.584
George is here.

13
00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.250
If he's here, why isn't he here?

14
00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:20.957
Yes. Good point.

15
00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:22.539
George.

16
00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:25.284
- Higgy boy.
- Good one.

17
00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:28.049
Hey. I love what you've done to the place.

18
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.962
Did you do it yourself
or get some poof to help you?

19
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.138
I could ask the same of your hair. Please.

20
00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.219
She's a cheeky one, isn't she?

21
00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:39.097
Right, love.
Listen, I've got training in a minute.

22
00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:42.733
So whatever it is
you need to get off your impressive chest,

23
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.480
- let me have it.
- Of course.

24
00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:45.563
You're fired.

25
00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:47.016
Yeah, right.

26
00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.646
And I'll be buying out
the remainder of your contract. So...

27
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.814
Wish you the best of luck.

28
00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:56.122
Fired? What the fuck for?

29
00:01:58.242 --> 00:02:00.953
I suppose I could go for
any number of reasons, really.

30
00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.326
Your casual misogyny, for one.

31
00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.245
- What?
- I know, it's a big word.

32
00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.963
Ask one of your daughters what it means.

33
00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:08.634
Or perhaps it's your performance,

34
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:12.631
having led this team through
yet another remarkably average season.

35
00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:15.295
Or maybe it's because you insist
on wearing those tiny shorts

36
00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:17.134
that force me to see
one of your testicles.

37
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.680
And there's the other one.

38
00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.429
Liam and Noel.

39
00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.519
Though, perhaps not an oasis.

40
00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:26.192
Still, if I'm being
completely honest, George,

41
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.531
you're fired because I'm the owner now,
and I don't like you.

42
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.949
Now do piss off, you fat twat.

43
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.991
Hey, Higgy boy.

44
00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.485
What do you think's worse?

45
00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:43.746
Your husband cheating on you
or being the last to know?

46
00:02:46.707 --> 00:02:48.957
Is there someone that could pop out
and fetch me a salad?

47
00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.009
Nothing with raisins in it, please.

48
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.219
Fuck you.

49
00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.263
So, what to do as far as new managers go?

50
00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.884
Shall I prepare a list of candidates?

51
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:03.643
No. That won't be necessary.

52
00:03:08.437 --> 00:03:11.728
This is a bit of surprising news
from the other side of the Atlantic.

53
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:14.606
AFC Richmond announced
the hiring of their new manager,

54
00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.944
one Theodore "Ted" Lasso.

55
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.409
Recently, it was Coach Lasso leading
the Division II Wichita State Shockers

56
00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:24.332
to their first ever national title
in American football.

57
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:26.923
He took the Shockers
from a garbage program

58
00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.919
all the way to the promised land
in his very first season as head coach.

59
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:34.012
But for a lot of us, that's not how
Ted Lasso found his way into our hearts,

60
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:35.588
certainly not into our living rooms.

61
00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.223
For me, it'll always be Ted...

62
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.472
celebrating a moment of joy with his team

63
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:42.764
in a way that you really have to see
to understand.

64
00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.348
And then, even when you see it...

65
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.350
I don't necessarily know
that understanding is what we're doing.

66
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.105
Right on, Ted. Do your thing, man.

67
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:54.531
And good luck
with the most beautiful game.

68
00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.236
Do us proud.

69
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.319
Go, 'Murica.

70
00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:12.502
Oi, mate. This you?

71
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.205
- I believe it is, yeah.
- Oh, man! Legend.

72
00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.547
Can I get an ussie?

73
00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.216
That's dope.

74
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.362
You know, back where I'm from,
we call those selfies.

75
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:22.636
Well, it's not "myself," yeah?

76
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.391
It's "us," innit? "Ussie."

77
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:25.893
Yeah. I like that.

78
00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:26.973
Wicked.

79
00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.814
You coaching football.

80
00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.363
Mate, you are a legend
for doing something so stupid.

81
00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:34.108
I mean, it's mental.
They're gonna fucking murder you.

82
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.990
Well, you know,
I've heard that tune before.

83
00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.699
But here I am, still dancing.

84
00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.108
- Legend.
- Yeah. Nice meeting you.

85
00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:47.196
What you reading? Another soccer book.

86
00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.576
Coach, you are a sponge.

87
00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:51.206
Come on. Hit me with a fun fact.

88
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.920
They don't say "out of bounds."
They say "into touch."

89
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.762
Okay, you owe me five bucks
if I sneak that into a sentence later.

90
00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.338
- You're on.
- Okay.

91
00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:02.052
Good evening.
We'll be dimming the cabin shortly.

92
00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:04.345
We should get some sleep.
The jet lag will kill us.

93
00:05:04.428 --> 00:05:06.678
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

94
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.730
Are we nuts for doing this?

95
00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:12.523
Yeah, this is nuts.

96
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:15.365
Hey, but taking on a challenge
is a lot like riding a horse, isn't it?

97
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.043
If you're comfortable
while you're doing it,

98
00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.067
probably doing it wrong.

99
00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.702
- Okay, good night, Coach.
- Night, Coach.

100
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.663
Hey, hey, hey!

101
00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:30.122
If we see each other in our dreams,
let's goof around a little bit,

102
00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:32.600
- pretend like we don't know each other.
- You got it, stranger.

103
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.043
Nice.

104
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.500
- You didn't sleep at all?
- Not a wink.

105
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.749
No. My brain just kept on cooking.

106
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.711
At first,
I was thinking about not sleeping.

107
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.420
Then I was thinking about
thinking about not sleeping. And that...

108
00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:18.843
That's never good.

109
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920
Next thing you know,

110
00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:21.845
they're handing out
warm chocolate chip cookies

111
00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.182
and the plane's landing.

112
00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:25.338
I didn't get a cookie. Did you eat mine?

113
00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.279
That's not part of the story.
I think this is us right here.

114
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.473
Hey, how ya doin'?

115
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.033
- My name's Ted. What's yours?
- Ollie.

116
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.576
- Ollie. All right.
- Let me get your bags.

117
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.980
No, no, no, Ollie.
We packed 'em, we'll carry 'em.

118
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.980
Love to make a little pit stop though.

119
00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.062
Okay. Follow me.

120
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.779
Yeah. There you go.

121
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.158
Coach, I got a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore, right?

122
00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.762
I've never actually said that
when not in Kansas before.

123
00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.536
- That's kinda nice.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:56.454
Well, thanks for indulging us, Ollie.

125
00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:57.922
Ready to boogie whenever you are.

126
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.500
Okay. That's Tower Bridge.

127
00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:02.415
Right. Not the London Bridge,
'cause this one's still up.

128
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.934
You know how they came up with soccer?

129
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.601
So, these Victorian-era headmasters,

130
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.430
all they wanted to do
was get the boys to stop masturbating.

131
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:17.187
So they invented a sport where the boys
wouldn't use their hands at all,

132
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.060
and they thought that might do the trick.

133
00:07:19.146 --> 00:07:20.817
I'm not sure if it worked, but...

134
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.576
Feels different, Coach.

135
00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.336
I mean, the same, but different.

136
00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.418
- Metaphor.
- You know it, baby.

137
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:43.593
Oi!

138
00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.721
Oi! Excuse me!

139
00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.009
Oi! Hello!

140
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:48.432
Off! Off!

141
00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.100
Stop touching the grass!

142
00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:52.889
Get off! Get off the pitch!
Stop touching the grass! Please!

143
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.367
- Yep, yep, yep. Yeah.
- Who are you?

144
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:56.310
I'm Ted Lasso. This is Coach Beard here.

145
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.653
- Oh, God. You're the new manager.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.399
- Take all the grass you want.
- Oh, no...

147
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.790
We just had it cut.
I can go through the garbage.

148
00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.975
- I can get you some more.
- That's all right. No need.

149
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.531
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

150
00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:08.987
Yeah.

151
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.552
- Still, we got to get off the grass.
- Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

152
00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:13.406
Do we apologize?

153
00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:15.132
- Sorry about that, grass.
- Sorry, grass.

154
00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:18.082
So, we're supposed to meet
with a Rebecca Welton.

155
00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:19.475
Yeah, that's where I'm taking you.

156
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.918
Look at this guy. One step ahead.

157
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.920
Hey, what's your name, by the way?

158
00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:24.093
- Me?
- Yeah.

159
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.550
No one ever asks my name.

160
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.169
I mean, whenever you're ready.

161
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.682
Oh, it's Nathan.

162
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.225
Nathan! I love that name.

163
00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:37.388
Hey, love your hot dogs.

164
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.100
Yeah. No, I know.

165
00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.605
Good, good.
Y'all got Nathan's hot dogs here?

166
00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:42.687
No.

167
00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:43.773
Okay.

168
00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:46.993
I love this kid. Love him.

169
00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:49.855
I'll introduce you. Big boss.

170
00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:50.947
Here we go.

171
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.490
Hello.

172
00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:06.255
Hey, how y'all doing?
I'm Ted Lasso, your new coach.

173
00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:09.717
- You must be Ms. Welton.
- Please, call me Rebecca.

174
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.009
Ms. Welton's my father.

175
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.642
If that's a joke, I love it.

176
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.519
If not, I cannot wait
to unpack that with you.

177
00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.056
This here is Coach Beard.

178
00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.269
It is so good
to finally meet you both face-to-face.

179
00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:21.192
Higgins?

180
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:24.899
Sorry. This is Higgins,
our current director of communications.

181
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:25.981
Current?

182
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.645
Could you take Coach Beard and get him
their IDs, housing information...

183
00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.235
You know, anything they need.

184
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.120
- Wi-Fi password, wet wipes.
- Humidifier. Way ahead of you, Coach.

185
00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.278
Thank you.

186
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.712
- Please, take a seat.
- Okay.

187
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.350
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes, please.

188
00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:44.394
Didn't get much sleep on the plane,
so anything you got,

189
00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:46.298
a little boost of caffeine,
should do the trick.

190
00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.165
You know, mochaccino, Frappuccino...

191
00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:51.004
Any coffee thing, as long as
I can't taste a hint of coffee, is good.

192
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.181
How do you take your tea?

193
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.760
Well, usually I take it
right back to the counter

194
00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:56.804
'cause someone's
made a horrible mistake. But...

195
00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:57.889
when in Rome, right?

196
00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:01.438
Yeah. Look at that. Okay.

197
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.230
Well?

198
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:09.335
You know, I always figured that tea
was just gonna taste like hot brown water.

199
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.528
And you know what?

200
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.321
I was right.
Yeah, it's horrible. No, thank you.

201
00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:14.654
Welcome to England.

202
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.259
Yeah. "Get used to it, sucker." Right?

203
00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:18.154
Now, would you like a tour?

204
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.623
- I'd love to see Abbey Road.
- Of the club.

205
00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:21.793
Yeah, let's start there.

206
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:26.881
So, this hall represents
the club's long, albeit modest, history.

207
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.799
The first match was played in 1897.

208
00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:33.048
During the war, our stadium
was used as a makeshift hospital.

209
00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.592
Yeah, some of the locals claim

210
00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.676
they still see fallen soldiers
wandering around the pitch.

211
00:10:37.763 --> 00:10:39.143
That's spooky.

212
00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:42.062
- Do you believe in ghosts, Ted?
- I do.

213
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:45.351
But more importantly, I think they need
to believe in themselves. You know?

214
00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:47.268
Okay.

215
00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.895
And this is a wall of our previous owners.

216
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.782
Okay. And now look at this fella up here.

217
00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:55.465
How 'bout the girls
and the champagne and everything?

218
00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:56.948
He looks like a good time.

219
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.241
That's my ex-husband.

220
00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:01.745
Well, good times aren't always
a good time, I've found.

221
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:03.657
You know, I heard about all that.

222
00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:05.037
How you holding up?

223
00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:08.609
Yeah, hasn't been the easiest year.

224
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.708
Yeah.

225
00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.087
- So, we'll need you to speak to the press.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.842
No, after a couple nights' good sleep,
I'll be happy to do so.

227
00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:18.426
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew.
They're ready for you now.

228
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.511
They're what?

229
00:11:21.807 --> 00:11:23.017
So, without further ado,

230
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.980
the new manager of AFC Richmond,
Ted Lasso!

231
00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:34.777
Okay.

232
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.701
All right. How y'all doing?

233
00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.163
There's Coach.

234
00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:43.793
Oluwa Ted, yo.

235
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.161
Look, our coach.

236
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.206
Oi!

237
00:11:48.292 --> 00:11:51.001
If I don't hear silence,
I'm gonna start punching dicks.

238
00:11:52.004 --> 00:11:54.423
One sec. Let me just...
Throat got a little dry.

239
00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.807
Did not expect fizzy water there. Sorry.

240
00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:03.808
Look at this twat!

241
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.390
Fucking Yank!

242
00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.384
Okay. So, hey.

243
00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.856
Why don't we just jump right in?
Anybody got any questions?

244
00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:13.726
Oh, yeah, no. Should've saw that coming.

245
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.777
You know what?
You can put your hands down.

246
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.990
Real quick...

247
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.159
Yeah.

248
00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:19.528
How about I go ahead and address

249
00:12:19.615 --> 00:12:21.904
the larger-than-average elephant
in the room.

250
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:27.121
No, I have never coached the sport
that you folks call football at any level.

251
00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:28.206
Jesus.

252
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:29.922
What?

253
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.879
Heck, you could fill two Internets
with what I don't know about football.

254
00:12:34.296 --> 00:12:35.606
But I'll tell you what I do know.

255
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.681
I know that AFC Richmond,
like any team I've ever coached,

256
00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:41.088
is gonna go out there
and give you everything they got

257
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.548
- for all four quarters.
- Halves.

258
00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.267
- What was that?
- Two halves.

259
00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:46.599
Right. Sorry. Halves, yeah.

260
00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:49.562
They're gonna give you everything they got
for two halves, win or lose.

261
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:50.725
Or tie.

262
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.562
Right. Y'all do ties here.

263
00:12:52.648 --> 00:12:54.834
Sorry. That's going to take
some getting used to for me.

264
00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.687
'Cause back where I'm from,
you try to end a game in a tie,

265
00:12:57.778 --> 00:13:00.857
well, that might as well
be the first sign of the apocalypse.

266
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.080
Now, look here.
I respect what you folks in the media do.

267
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.000
And my door is always gonna be open.

268
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.500
All right? You can ask me anything.
No topic will be into touch.

269
00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:13.923
All right, one final question.

270
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.544
How about the fellow right there
in the second row.

271
00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:17.587
Yeah.

272
00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:19.715
I like your glasses.

273
00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:21.644
Thank you.

274
00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:23.683
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

275
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:26.010
I just wanna make sure I have this right.

276
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.388
You're an American
who's never set foot in England,

277
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:31.434
whose athletic success
has only come at the amateur level...

278
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.559
A second-tier one at that...

279
00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:35.606
And is now being charged
with the leadership

280
00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:37.230
of a Premier League football club,

281
00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:40.606
despite clearly possessing
very little knowledge of the game.

282
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.070
You got a question in there, Trent?

283
00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:44.946
Yeah.

284
00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.203
Is this a fucking joke?

285
00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:50.866
- Thank you, Trent!
- I love journalists.

286
00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:54.039
I mean, can you even name any footballers?

287
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:57.296
Well, yeah, you got Ronaldo
and the fellow that bends it like himself.

288
00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.566
- Fucking Beckham! Made a film on it!
- You dickhead, mate.

289
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.759
Who the fuck are you?

290
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:03.000
Do you know how many games
are in a Premiership season?

291
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.291
Not off the top of my head, no.

292
00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.023
Nobody can understand you.

293
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.518
Who won the league last year?

294
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.639
I actually don't know the answer to that.
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:13.479
What's a goalie?

296
00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:16.081
The fella with the big Mickey Mouse hands
and the... by the net.

297
00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.566
This is bleak.

298
00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.149
You need to go back to America.

299
00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:30.658
Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. No, no, I...

300
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.076
The bubbles!

301
00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:37.086
Fucking hell!

302
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.510
Coach Lasso.

303
00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:42.217
Good Lord.
You must forgive my fellow countrymen.

304
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.088
Somewhere over the last few years,

305
00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:47.385
we seem to have abandoned
all sense of manners and hospitality.

306
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:49.971
My, my, aren't you a salty bunch?

307
00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:53.017
But I can't remember the last time
the press room was this full.

308
00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.519
Yet here you all are.

309
00:14:55.604 --> 00:14:57.364
Maybe you're not such a mad notion
after all.

310
00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:00.187
And despite the number of you here,

311
00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:02.184
there is not a single person in this room

312
00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.447
who has seen Richmond play
more than I have.

313
00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:08.370
And in all those years under
the stewardship of the previous owner,

314
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.700
I've witnessed nothing
but profound mediocrity.

315
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.291
Am I wrong?

316
00:15:14.373 --> 00:15:15.582
Well, it's a bit harsh.

317
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.500
Am I wrong?

318
00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:21.764
No.

319
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.639
Now, Coach Lasso may not have the CV
that you all find acceptable,

320
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.927
but he does have one thing
this club doesn't:

321
00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.432
a trophy from this millennium.

322
00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.884
So, like it or not, Richmond
are changing the way we do things.

323
00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:38.057
And from now on,
that way is the "Lasso way."

324
00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:43.778
We look forward to seeing you all
at our next match with Crystal Palace.

325
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.240
Thank you so much.

326
00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:48.374
Nice meeting y'all.

327
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.738
And sorry for spittin'
on all your stuff up here.

328
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:52.493
Thank you.

329
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.790
I give him three weeks.

330
00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:59.245
Oh, boy. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what happened.

331
00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.594
Ted, don't you think about them
for another second.

332
00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:02.669
You have a job to do.

333
00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.844
And proving them wrong,
just been added to the list.

334
00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.682
I appreciate that... Thank you, Coach.

335
00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:07.758
Yeah.

336
00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:12.104
See, I'm fine when there's no bubbles.
You know, I can do that all day.

337
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.561
Okay. You know,
I'd love to say hi to the team, if I can.

338
00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.653
Can't keep a gaffer from his pitch.

339
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.442
You can say that again. Okay.

340
00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.073
I am 0 for 2 in that sentence.

341
00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.283
Ms. Welton, I was a bit skeptical,

342
00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:31.581
but after hearing you speak in there,
I'm excited by your choice.

343
00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.988
Coach Lasso is just what we need.

344
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:35.366
He's an absolute wanker.

345
00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:36.293
I know.

346
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.661
Pardon?

347
00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:39.207
I hope he fails miserably.

348
00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:45.302
See, my ex-husband truly loved
only one thing his entire life: this club.

349
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:49.134
And Ted Lasso is gonna help me
burn it to the ground.

350
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.303
'Cause I want to torture Rupert.

351
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:57.351
I want him to feel like he's being fucked
in the ass with a splintered cricket bat.

352
00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:01.563
Just in and out, over and over,
in a constant loop.

353
00:17:01.647 --> 00:17:03.067
Like a GIF.

354
00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:05.941
That's what GIFs do, isn't it?
They're just...

355
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.403
endless.

356
00:17:09.488 --> 00:17:11.448
That's correct.

357
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:16.078
Though some people pronounce it "JIF."

358
00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:19.667
- Thank you, Higgins.
- Thank you.

359
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:26.050
Okay, let me use it in a sentence,
so it sticks.

360
00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:27.298
The "gaffer"... me...

361
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.971
- is going out to the "pitch"...
- Yeah.

362
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.567
The grass here... to watch practice.

363
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.432
"Training." They call practice "training."

364
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.510
All this vernacular. Gonna be tough.

365
00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:37.200
You know what? I'm gonna get it though.
'Cause training makes perfect.

366
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:38.223
There you go.

367
00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:39.808
There's our man.

368
00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:47.027
Jesus, Mary and fuckface Joseph!

369
00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.648
Eyes on the man you're marking! Come on!

370
00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.034
- Who is that?
- Roy Kent.

371
00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:55.034
Team captain.
Classic old-school box-to-box midfielder.

372
00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:58.406
- Definitely lost a step.
- But, you know, he's a legend.

373
00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:00.174
Won a Champions League with Chelsea, so...

374
00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.665
- Eight years ago.
- Yeah.

375
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.455
Oh, God, what?

376
00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.633
That is a darn fine sports mix,
young fella.

377
00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:09.844
Coach, you try this?

378
00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:19.534
That does not come lightly
from that fella, I'll tell you that.

379
00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.057
You continue to impress, Nathan.

380
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.691
You remembered my name.

381
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.185
Holy smokes! Did you see that?

382
00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:30.284
That fella looked like a kitty cat
when it gets spooked by a cucumber.

383
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.400
- Who the heck is that?
- Jamie Tartt.

384
00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.067
Top scorer on the team.

385
00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.155
Fuck off.

386
00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.986
- Nate, what's he like?
- Who, Jamie?

387
00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:39.866
He's great.

388
00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.204
You know, at football.

389
00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.463
Yeah, I know fellas like that.

390
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:49.211
Sam Obisanya. He's a right back defender
outta the Nigerian league.

391
00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:51.046
Nigeria? Like Africa?

392
00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.932
So these fellas
are from all over the place?

393
00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:55.088
I'm open, boyo.

394
00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.653
I mean, he must be from England, yeah?

395
00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:58.177
- Wales.
- Is that another country?

396
00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:01.103
- Yes and no.
- How many countries are in this country?

397
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.353
- Four.
- Four.

398
00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:05.228
It's kinda like America these days.

399
00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:06.864
Right.

400
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.833
I do love a locker room.

401
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.325
Smells like potential.

402
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.712
And am I getting notes of Axe body spray?

403
00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:30.344
Spot on, Coach.

404
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.259
But I think they call it
something else here.

405
00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:42.472
Ding, ding, ding.

406
00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:44.848
Lynx.

407
00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:47.153
My favorite of the jungle cats.

408
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.319
Come here. Look at your face.
Look at your face.

409
00:19:54.403 --> 00:19:55.492
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

410
00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:06.751
Yeesh.

411
00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:08.211
Last time I saw eyes that cold,

412
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:10.291
they were going head-to-head
with Roy Scheider.

413
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.336
- Jaws?
- No, All That Jazz.

414
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:14.300
I'm gonna say something. Howdy, fellas.

415
00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.181
Don't stop what you're doing.

416
00:20:16.258 --> 00:20:18.637
My name's Ted Lasso.
This here is Coach Beard.

417
00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:20.679
I know we don't officially start
quite yet,

418
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:23.102
but, you know,
we just wanted to pop in, say howdy,

419
00:20:23.182 --> 00:20:25.061
let you know
how excited we are to be here...

420
00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:26.271
Knock, knock.

421
00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.310
Is everyone in here decent?

422
00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:32.653
Boys, that's disappointing.

423
00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:36.953
Oh, shit. Am I interrupting you?

424
00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:39.568
No, no, that's okay. How can I help you?

425
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.365
No, I'm here to pick up that one.

426
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.869
Yeah. Sorry, Coach.

427
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.121
She made me an appointment.
I'm getting waxed.

428
00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.121
It's more for the fans than it is for me.

429
00:20:48.207 --> 00:20:50.826
Score a goal, gotta take my shirt off.

430
00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.498
Sweetheart.

431
00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.118
I mean, I can stay if you want.

432
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:57.381
No, that's okay.

433
00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:58.875
All right, cheers.

434
00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.297
- Yeah.
- There you go.

435
00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:01.403
All right, kid, after you.

436
00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.218
You're gonna be a gentleman now, are you?

437
00:21:03.305 --> 00:21:05.055
No, babe. Just gonna watch your ass.

438
00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.681
Fuck off.

439
00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:10.347
Watch it and weep.

440
00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:19.451
Anyhoo, thank you for your time.

441
00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:05.617
Coach. You gotta stay up.

442
00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:09.203
Come on, man. Don't be a sleep cop.

443
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.171
Roy! Hey, Roy!

444
00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:17.627
Yeah? What do you want?

445
00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:19.923
It was real fun
watching you out there today.

446
00:22:20.007 --> 00:22:22.257
You know, the boys really respond to you.

447
00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.741
It doesn't surprise me though.
You've had a heck of a career.

448
00:22:25.304 --> 00:22:26.354
Thank you.

449
00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:31.435
Never thought it would end
being coached by Ronald fucking McDonald.

450
00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:40.438
You gonna let him call you that?

451
00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:42.007
I don't think he was referring to me.

452
00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:45.484
He thinks he's mad now,
wait till we win him over.

453
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.740
He'll be furious.

454
00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:50.076
You got any tape?

455
00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:26.154
What you doing in there?

456
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:29.406
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

457
00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:30.992
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

458
00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:32.248
I shouldn't laugh.

459
00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:33.868
It's okay.

460
00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:37.915
No, I was just making some adjustments
to the locker room here.

461
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.500
Nice, yeah.

462
00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:43.046
Though, I believe it's crooked.

463
00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.736
Now here I am thinking it was the room
that was all outta whack.

464
00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:48.359
But you know what? I think you're right.

465
00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:51.677
What you doing back here? Where's Jamie?

466
00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:53.265
He left his phone in his locker.

467
00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:54.940
Why didn't he come get it?

468
00:23:55.018 --> 00:23:57.438
He's still getting waxed.
He's surprisingly furry.

469
00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.721
The hair was, like, growing back
while she was doing it.

470
00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:01.936
- Come on, now.
- May I?

471
00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:03.775
- Yeah, yeah. Help yourself.
- Thanks.

472
00:24:11.701 --> 00:24:13.412
Lower it down on that side.

473
00:24:13.494 --> 00:24:14.494
Great.

474
00:24:14.579 --> 00:24:15.750
Keep going. Little bit.

475
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:17.664
Teeny bit more.

476
00:24:17.749 --> 00:24:19.328
Stop! That's perfect.

477
00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:21.917
All right. How 'bout that? Nice teamwork.

478
00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:24.553
- Pow. Yeah.
- Old-school.

479
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:27.090
- I'm Keeley, by the way.
- Yeah. Hey, I'm Ted Lasso.

480
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:29.296
No, I know. You're trending hard
on Twitter right now.

481
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:30.546
How 'bout that.

482
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:32.931
- Do you even tweet?
- Nah.

483
00:24:33.015 --> 00:24:34.424
But I do beatbox all right.

484
00:24:43.817 --> 00:24:46.817
I never know how to react
when a grown man beatboxes in front of me.

485
00:24:46.903 --> 00:24:48.864
Well, I hope
you never run into Biz Markie.

486
00:24:50.449 --> 00:24:51.739
All right.

487
00:24:51.825 --> 00:24:54.694
Well, if you get curious and you start
searching around on Twitter,

488
00:24:54.786 --> 00:24:56.326
I would avoid #Richmond.

489
00:24:56.413 --> 00:24:59.462
- Okay.
- Or wanker. Or dick.

490
00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:01.752
Well, I'll take your word for it.

491
00:25:02.752 --> 00:25:04.843
Welcome to England.

492
00:25:12.846 --> 00:25:14.806
Thank you.
Hey, and thanks again for the lift.

493
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:15.890
That's all right.

494
00:25:15.932 --> 00:25:17.563
Hey, this you, Nate?

495
00:25:17.643 --> 00:25:19.522
That one? God, no.
No, couldn't handle that.

496
00:25:19.603 --> 00:25:21.103
This is me. Green one here.

497
00:25:21.188 --> 00:25:23.567
Right. So, get that in there.

498
00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:24.648
Come on.

499
00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:27.363
Already burning the midnight oil,
I see, Ted.

500
00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:28.653
Well, as the man once said,

501
00:25:28.737 --> 00:25:31.317
"The harder you work,
the luckier you get," huh?

502
00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:33.199
On the diagonal.

503
00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:35.302
My apologies, Ted.
We should have ordered you a car.

504
00:25:35.326 --> 00:25:36.656
Oh, no. That's okay.

505
00:25:36.744 --> 00:25:37.825
- Night, y'all.
- Got it.

506
00:25:41.375 --> 00:25:42.375
What is wrong with you?

507
00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:44.588
It's just that everything
I've eaten today...

508
00:25:45.546 --> 00:25:47.455
feels like it's stuck right here.

509
00:25:49.508 --> 00:25:50.758
I got it. I got it.

510
00:25:52.802 --> 00:25:53.802
Here we go.

511
00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:57.176
He seems like such a nice man.
I'm not sure I can do this.

512
00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:00.392
Obviously, for this to work,

513
00:26:00.477 --> 00:26:04.856
I'm going to need the full support
of my new director of football operations.

514
00:26:05.857 --> 00:26:08.278
I'm assuming that's a promotion
and substantial pay rise

515
00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:10.859
that would be of interest to you
and your family.

516
00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:15.527
Hey, look, this car's got
an invisible steering wheel!

517
00:26:17.702 --> 00:26:18.702
I'm just kidding.

518
00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:20.454
It's my man Nate here running the horn.

519
00:26:20.538 --> 00:26:23.169
You're a godsend, Ted Lasso.

520
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.089
Takes one to know one.

521
00:26:29.756 --> 00:26:30.756
Well?

522
00:26:32.092 --> 00:26:33.301
I accept.

523
00:26:33.384 --> 00:26:34.505
Wonderful.

524
00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:42.134
Oh, and Higgins,

525
00:26:42.227 --> 00:26:45.017
I know that there'll be elements
to this little adventure

526
00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:46.394
that will weigh on you a bit.

527
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.730
But I'm sure it won't be harder
than it was

528
00:26:48.817 --> 00:26:51.817
to sneak all Rupert's women in and out
behind my back all those years.

529
00:27:07.169 --> 00:27:08.298
This is you, Coach.

530
00:27:09.337 --> 00:27:11.548
Okay. All right. You good?

531
00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:13.221
- I'm good. You good?
- Yeah.

532
00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:14.527
- Night, Coach.
- Good night, Coach.

533
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.010
I almost forgot.

534
00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:18.814
What's this for?

535
00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:20.558
- "Into touch."
- Get some sleep, Coach.

536
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:21.851
Yeah, I will.

537
00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:11.566
Hey, big guy. How you doing?
How was school today?

538
00:28:12.942 --> 00:28:13.863
Right.

539
00:28:13.943 --> 00:28:15.534
No, I forgot.

540
00:28:15.612 --> 00:28:17.872
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a little loopy today.

541
00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:20.776
Yeah. Yeah, you could say that.

542
00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:24.788
No, no, that's okay. No.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

543
00:28:24.872 --> 00:28:26.422
Yeah. Yeah, go do your thing. Yeah.

544
00:28:26.498 --> 00:28:28.077
Hey, is your mom there?

545
00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:30.246
Okay. Thanks, big guy.

546
00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:31.414
Hey, I miss you.

547
00:28:34.047 --> 00:28:35.547
Yeah, I love you too.

548
00:28:36.258 --> 00:28:37.258
Okay.

549
00:28:46.768 --> 00:28:48.097
Hey, how you doing?

550
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:51.440
Yeah. Well, you know,
so far so good. You know?

551
00:28:52.857 --> 00:28:55.188
It's gonna take
some getting used to, yeah.

552
00:28:55.277 --> 00:28:57.947
But I think once we get going,
it's gonna go all right.

553
00:28:58.864 --> 00:29:01.413
Yeah. No, that's true, that's true. Yeah.

554
00:29:02.326 --> 00:29:04.996
Well, you know what?
It's actually pretty nice. Yeah.

555
00:29:06.163 --> 00:29:08.833
Yeah, and tell you what,
they got a cute neighborhood too.

556
00:29:08.915 --> 00:29:09.915
Yeah.

557
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.380
Yeah, you and the little guy
gotta get on over here.

558
00:29:12.461 --> 00:29:13.631
Come check it out.

559
00:29:18.634 --> 00:29:19.933
What? No, what did I say?

560
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:26.142
But that's what I'm doing though.
I'm giving you that space.

561
00:29:27.768 --> 00:29:28.768
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:29:28.852 --> 00:29:30.352
Yeah, and myself. Right.

563
00:29:32.647 --> 00:29:33.688
Okay.

564
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:36.441
No, no. That's okay. Yeah, yeah.

565
00:29:36.527 --> 00:29:37.777
Hey, Michelle.

566
00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:40.413
I love you.

567
00:29:44.409 --> 00:29:46.368
No, no, that's okay. You don't have to.

568
00:29:47.621 --> 00:29:49.621
Really. Yeah.

569
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.590
Okay.

570
00:29:55.962 --> 00:29:57.762
All right, now. Good night.

571
00:30:15.273 --> 00:30:17.943
Shoot. Now I can't sleep.
